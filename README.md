## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

**InvestiSphere** is a powerful, AI-driven platform designed to provide comprehensive investment analysis reports for publicly traded stocks. Leveraging a sophisticated multi-agent architecture powered by Azure OpenAI, this application gathers real-time financial data, performs fundamental, technical, and macroeconomic analysis, and synthesizes these findings into a downloadable PDF report, complete with charts and forecasts.

This project showcases the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with real-time data sources and vector databases to create an intelligent system capable of complex financial reasoning and report generation.

---

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

* **Real-time Data Ingestion:** Automatically scrapes company information, news, and historical stock data using `yfinance`.
* **Vector Database Storage:** Processes and embeds scraped data into ticker-specific FAISS vector stores, synchronized with Azure Blob Storage for persistence.
* **Multi-Agent Analysis:**
    * **Fundamental Analyst:** Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze company health based on scraped data.
    * **Technical Analyst:** Calculates key indicators (SMAs, RSI), generates candlestick charts, provides a 30-day conceptual forecast, and uses AI for interpretation.
    * **Macroeconomic Analyst:** Fetches live market indicators (S&P 500, Treasury Yields, Oil Prices) and uses AI to assess their impact.
    * **Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Agent:** Orchestrates the workflow, synthesizes findings from all specialist agents, and generates the final recommendation.
* **Interactive Frontend:** A modern Next.js dashboard allows users to input tickers, view interactive forecast charts, and trigger report generation.
* **PDF Report Generation:** Creates a professional, downloadable PDF report containing all analysis sections, the technical chart, and the final synthesized recommendation.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilizes FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to handle the potentially long-running report generation process without timing out user requests, providing a smooth user experience via polling.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

Fin-AI Analyst employs a decoupled, asynchronous, multi-agent architecture designed for scalability and robustness.



**Core Components:**

1.  **Frontend (Next.js):**
    * Provides the user interface for ticker input and displaying results.
    * Makes API calls to the FastAPI backend.
    * Renders the interactive forecast chart using Chart.js.
    * Handles polling for report status and initiates PDF downloads.
2.  **Backend (FastAPI):**
    * Exposes RESTful API endpoints for:
        * Fetching forecast data (`/forecast/{ticker}`).
        * Starting a new report generation job (`/generate-and-analyze/{ticker}`).
        * Checking job status (`/get-report-status/{job_id}`).
        * Downloading the completed PDF report (`/download-report/{job_id}`).
        * (Admin) Manually triggering data ingestion (`/ingest/{ticker}`).
    * Uses `BackgroundTasks` to handle long-running ingestion and analysis processes asynchronously.
    * Manages application state (agent instances, job statuses).
3.  **Data Ingestion Layer:**
    * **Data Scraper Agent:** Triggered by the `/ingest` or `/generate-and-analyze` endpoints. Fetches data from `yfinance`.
    * **Azure OpenAI Embeddings:** Converts textual data (company info, news) into vector embeddings.
    * **FAISS Vector Store:** Stores embeddings and document mappings in **ticker-specific** index files (e.g., `AAPL_index.faiss`). Managed by the `FAISSManager`.
    * **Azure Blob Storage Sync:** The `FAISSManager` synchronizes these index files with Azure Blob Storage for persistence.
4.  **Analysis Layer (Multi-Agent System):**
    * **RAG Retriever:** Fetches relevant documents (company info, news) for a specific ticker from the correct FAISS index file.
    * **Fundamental Analyst Agent:** Uses the RAG context to generate a fundamental health summary via Azure OpenAI.
    * **Technical Analyst Agent:** Fetches live data, calculates indicators, generates a PNG chart, creates forecast data, and uses Azure OpenAI to interpret technical signals *and* the forecast trend.
    * **Macroeconomic Analyst Agent:** Fetches live market indicators, combines them with company context, and uses Azure OpenAI for macro analysis.
5.  **Orchestration & Synthesis Layer:**
    * **CIO Agent:** Manages the workflow. It calls the specialist agents, gathers their findings (including the chart path), synthesizes a final recommendation using Azure OpenAI, and then uses `fpdf2` to assemble the complete PDF report.

**Workflow (User Perspective):**

1.  User enters a ticker (e.g., "AAPL") in the frontend and clicks "Generate Forecast".
2.  Frontend calls `GET /forecast/AAPL`. Backend returns historical + forecast data. Frontend displays the chart.
3.  User clicks "Download Full Report".
4.  Frontend calls `POST /generate-and-analyze/AAPL`.
5.  Backend starts a background task, immediately returns a `job_id`.
6.  Frontend shows a loading message and starts polling `GET /get-report-status/{job_id}` every 5 seconds.
7.  **Background Task:**
    * Runs `DataScraperAgent` for AAPL (fetches, embeds, saves `AAPL_index.faiss`, syncs to Azure). Updates job status to "ingesting".
    * Runs `CIOAgent` orchestration:
        * Loads `AAPL_index.faiss`.
        * Runs Fundamental, Technical, Macro agents.
        * Synthesizes recommendation.
        * Generates `Investment_Report_AAPL_....pdf`. Updates job status to "analyzing".
    * Updates job status to "complete" with the PDF path.
8.  Frontend polling sees "complete" status, enables a download link pointing to `GET /download-report/{job_id}`.
9.  User clicks the link. Backend serves the PDF file via `FileResponse`.
